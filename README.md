  # OPS-IN Ticket System

### Open Source Incident Ticket System


Over the years, I have spent significant portion of my time to assisting startups and enterprises in building their security capabilities and most common problems 
that I have encounter is budget allocation and resources(Man power). 

Like some companies are literally using Google Sheets or free tier Jira to track tickets but I don't find it very good approach.

So, I thought of creating a small open source utility that can help smaller and lean teams in managing the tickets effectively.

This utility is still under development but it's fully functional minus the frontend :-P.

I would greatly appreciate any contributions in the development of this open source platform. 

## Benefits to using OPS-IN Ticket System.

1. Completely free to use that can help you save significant amount of money like no monthly billings, just run it on internal retricted EC2 Micro instance and it should work.
2. You can modify and customize "OPS-IN Ticket System" the way you want.
3. Better team collaboration no more hassle of tagging users individually in Spreadsheets.
4. Very small and Scalable incident ticketing system that can handle large volumes of tickets and users.

## Upcoming Update:

1. Frontend with Dashboard and intial functionality to create, update, search and delete incidents functionality.
2. Option to add user authetication on the frontend page.
